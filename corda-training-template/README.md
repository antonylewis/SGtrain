# CorDapp Template

This is the template that we'll be using as a base for developing our IOU CorDapp in the hands-on section of the training.

You'll want to clone this repo to your local machine (e.g. using `git clone https://bitbucket.org/R3-CEV/corda-training-template.git`) and add code to it as we go.

For each exercise in the training, solutions can be found here: https://bitbucket.org/joeldudleyr3/corda-training-solutions. Take a look if you aren't able to complete an exercise, or if you want to compare your implementation to ours.

If you're having any trouble, ask the instructor or check out the Getting Set Up page here: https://docs.corda.net/getting-set-up.html.
